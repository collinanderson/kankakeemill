<h1>Kankakee Mill Race ("Coquillard's Folly")</h1>

Starting near his mill on the St. Joseph River, near South Bend, Coquillard had
workmen dig a canal to the Kankakee. The canal ran southwest through the north
lot of the Turner Hall grounds on North Michgian Street, then west along what
is now Navarre Street, turning southwest through the city cemetery to
Washington Avenue at Birdsell Street, then through what was low ground and
continuing west. A portion of the original canal can still be found in City
Cemetery. The soil was loose and sandy, with a large portion of muck.
Unfortunately, the engineer had miscalculated and the water flowed west instead
of east in his race. A coffer dam of timber and lumber was built to form a
bulkhead that would turn the water in the right direction. After much heart-
breaking work, Coquillard realized that it was a disaster.

    The "Free Press" of January 3, 1837, calls attention to the
advertisement in their paper for millwrights to engage to build the
Kankakee Customs Mill, and says: "From the enterprise of the
gentlemen who are about to erect the establisment and the un-
equalled power which the union of the Kankakee and St. Joseph
affords, we have no doubt but what this Mill will be equal if not
superior to any similar establishment west of Rochester (N. Y.).
There are three different sites on the Kankakee Canal, upon which
machinery is to be erected during the ensuing summer." The ad-
vertisement for Mill Wrights was signed not only by Mr. Coquillard
but by John Hendricks and John Rush.

    The same edition contains a lengthy advertisement for the
sale of building lots, signed by Wm. S. Vail, Samuel Martin and
F. R. Tutt.

    This project of digging a race was in the minds of many people
at that time, but only Coquillard and his associates attempted it.
The idea was to divert the waters of the Kankakee into the St.
Joseph producing an almost unlimited water power. The race was
dug, according to Mr. Charles Wattles of the Abstract and Title
Company, from about the alley between Navarre and Marion run-
ning east and west, continuing west through the old City Cemetery
to Stanfield's or Beck's Lake. Then it was found that the location
of this lake was a water shed. The water leaked away in the loose
soil and so little reached South Bend that the venture was a failure.
Mr. Coquillard lost a hundred thousand dollars in the project. The
ditch in the City Cemetery is the only evidence at the present time
of the Kankakee Race or "Coquillard's Folly" as it was sometimes
called.  To secure money for the digging of the Kankakee Race,
Mr. Coquillard mortgaged to the State Bank large holdings in the
northeast, northwest and north of the present original plat of South
Bend, consisting of farm land and city lots, to the amount of
$45,639.85. This mortgage is dated July 22nd, 1841, and was fore-
closed during the September term of the St. Joseph Circuit Court
in 1844.
